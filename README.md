======================

This is a project where the new guys are working in css and html5 helping by me as a trainer. We are building a home page from PSD.


**HomeWork**

You have to start the markup (make the html5 view) ...Note : Make some info in
this readme about this project and your name with link to your github account(each one should do the same thing). 
Please remove this comment when the list of members and description are ready.
